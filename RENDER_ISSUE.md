# Render Deployment Issue Fix

## Problem
Render is running `python3 app.py` directly instead of using `gunicorn app:app` from Procfile.
The error shows it's failing before our path setup code runs, suggesting it's using cached/old code.

## Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Check Render Configuration
In Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service settings
2. Check **"Start Command"** - should be: `gunicorn app:app`
3. Check **"Root Directory"** - should be: `.` (not `src/` or anything else)
4. If "Root Directory" is set to `src/`, that's the problem! Change it to `.`

### Option 2: Force Clear Cache and Redeploy
1. In Render dashboard: **Settings** → **Clear build cache**
2. **Manual Deploy** → **Clear build cache & deploy**

### Option 3: Verify Procfile is Used
Make sure Render is reading the Procfile. If not, set Start Command explicitly to: `gunicorn app:app`

## Most Likely Issue
Render probably has "Root Directory" set to `src/`, which is why:
- app.py appears at `/opt/render/project/src/app.py`
- Imports can't find `src` module (because from that location, src would be at `../src/`)

## Quick Fix
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Settings → Scroll to "Environment"
3. Make sure "Root Directory" is empty or set to `.`
4. Set "Start Command" to: `gunicorn app:app`
5. Clear cache and redeploy
