# Value Betting Calculations - Verification Report

## ‚úÖ All Formulas Verified Correct

### 1. Value (Edge) Calculation
**Formula:** `value = predicted_prob - implied_prob`
- **Correct** ‚úì
- If model predicts 87.79% and bookmaker odds imply 83.33%, edge = +4.46%
- Positive value means Unfavored betting opportunity

### 2. Expected Value (EV) Calculation  
**Formula:** `EV = (predicted_prob √ó odds) - 1`
- **Correct** ‚úì
- Represents average profit per $1 bet over the long term
- Example: 0.8779 √ó 1.2 - 1 = 0.0535 three¬± 5.35% expected return per $1

### 3. Kelly Criterion Calculation
**Formula:** `kelly = (predicted_prob √ó odds - 1) / (odds - 1)` for odds > 1
- **Correct** ‚úì
- Optimal bet size as fraction of bankroll for long-term growth
- **Safety:** Capped at 25% to avoid excessive risk

### 4. Value Bet Detection
**Logic:** Only recommend bets where `value > 0`
- **Correct** ‚úì
- Checks both players and recommends the one with higher value
- Sorts recommendations by value percentage (highest first)

## ‚úÖ Test Results

All automated tests pass:
- Simple value bet calculation
- Negative value bet rejection  
- High probability favorite handling
- Multiple model recommendations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning for Real Money Betting

### Mock Odds vs Real Odds

**Current Implementation:**
- When no API key is provided, the system generates **simulated odds** from model predictions
- These mock odds include:
  - ¬±8% variance to simulate bookmaker disagreement
  - 6% bookmaker margin
  - Deterministic generation (same match = same odds)

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE MOCK ODDS FOR REAL BETTING:**
- Mock odds are generated FROM your model, so value is artificial
- For real value betting, you MUST use actual bookmaker odds from an API
- The system will display a warning when using mock odds

### How to Use Real Odds

1. **Get API Key:** Sign up for The Odds API (the-odds-api.com) or similar
2. **Set Environment Variable:** `export ODDS_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. **Verify:** Check that odds come from real bookmakers (bet365, draftkings, etc.)
4. **No Warning:** When using real odds, no warning message will appear

## üìä What the Numbers Mean

### Value Percentage
- **What:** Difference between your model's probability and bookmaker's implied probability
- **Example:** +4.46% means model thinks player is 4.46% more likely than bookmaker
- **Action:** Only bet when value > 0

### Expected Value (EV)
- **What:** Average profit per $1 bet over many bets
- **Example:** +5.35% means expect $0.0535 profit per $1 bet on average
- **Note:** Individual bets can still lose - this is long-term average

### Kelly Criterion
- **What:** Optimal bet size as % of your total bankroll
- **Example:** 25% means bet 25% of your bankroll (capped for safety)
- **Note:** Conservative approach uses fractional Kelly (e.g., half Kelly = 12.5%)

## ‚úÖ Safety Features

1. **Kelly Capping:** Maximum 25% of bankroll to prevent over-betting
2. **Value Threshold:** Only positive value bets recommended
3. **Mock Odds Warning:** Clear warning when using simulated odds
4. **Model Prioritization:** Random Forest used for profit calculations (most reliable)

## üìù Recommendations for Real Betting

1. **Start Small:** Test with small amounts first
2. **Use Fractional Kelly:** Bet 25-50% of recommended Kelly amount
3. **Track Results:** Keep detailed records of all bets
4. **Bankroll Management:** Never bet more than you can afford to lose
5. **Verify Odds:** Always confirm odds match actual bookmaker odds before betting
6. **Model Validation:** Continue to track model accuracy and adjust confidence accordingly
