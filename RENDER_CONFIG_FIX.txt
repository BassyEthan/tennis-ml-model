🔧 URGENT: Fix Render Configuration

The issue is that Render is NOT using your Procfile and has wrong settings.

STEPS TO FIX:

1. Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service → Settings

2. Check "Start Command":
   ❌ WRONG: (empty or python3 app.py)
   ✅ CORRECT: gunicorn app:app

3. Check "Root Directory":
   ❌ WRONG: src/ or src
   ✅ CORRECT: . (dot) or leave EMPTY

4. Clear Build Cache:
   - Settings → Scroll down
   - Click "Clear build cache"
   
5. Save and Redeploy

The Root Directory being set to "src/" is why app.py appears at 
/opt/render/project/src/app.py - that's the problem!
